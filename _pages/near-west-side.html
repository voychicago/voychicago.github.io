###  Near West Side

Our *Near West Side* location offers furnished or unfurnished options to fit your needs. If you've ever wanted gorgeous views of the city but didn't want to pay extra for them, one of these units could be the one for you.

Our building is uniquely situated between Tri-Taylor/Illinois Medical District, a few blocks from Rush Hospital, and one block from Blue Line and Malcolm X College. It also provides easy access to I-90/94 and I-290, with private parking space plus easy off-street parking available.

During the playing season, you can experience the immense magnitude of support for the Blackhawks and Bulls from the comfort of your home as fans make their way to the United Center (also a few blocks away along with the new Bulls training facility).
